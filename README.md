Planning: Problem: You have ingredients in your kitchen that you want to cook with, so they dont't sit there until they expire. Wouldn't be nice to search for recipes based on those ingredients? The user should know what ingredients they have before they search. I decided I would create my database and models first. Then I would create my routes. In order to make sure my routes would work I knew I would need to make my ejs files. All of the styling would happen at the end of the project.



MVP: User can log in and search for recipes by ingredients. After finding recipes they like they can save them to "my recipes". They also can store the ingredients they currently have in "my pantry". 

Bugs/Obstacles: I used a lot of <br> so that pages were a certain length. Bootstrap. Trying to make my get route that has my api call into a post route. I can tell when things look good, but I am very bad at creating things that look good. I would have liked to do a lot more styling.


features: Search that gets information from an API

tech: I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Express

Stretch Goals: Make it so the user can add items to their gorcery list by seeing the ingrdients in a recipe
